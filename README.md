# Predictive-Analytics

The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the
assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a
Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.

PART - 1 Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms <br>
● Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest<br>
● Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA<br>
● Implement K-Means Clustering<br>
● Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of squares<br>

PART - 2 Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning<br>
● Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, KNN<br>
● Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the above-mentioned algorithm.<br>
● Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5 classifiers (including the ensemble).<br>
